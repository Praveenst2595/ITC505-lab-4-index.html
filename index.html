        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Font Choices:</strong> The fonts 'Lora' and 'Merriweather' were chosen for their readability and professional appearance. 'Lora' is used for body text to provide a clean, modern look, while 'Merriweather' is used for headings to create a clear hierarchy and draw attention to section titles.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Sizes of Headings and Main Text:</strong> The main heading (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is set to 2.5em to ensure it stands out as the most important element on the page. Subheadings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) are sized at 2em and 1.5em respectively to create a visual hierarchy, making the content easy to scan. The main text is set to 1.1em to enhance readability.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Color Choices:</strong> The color palette is chosen for clarity and professionalism. The background color (#f9f9f9) provides a neutral backdrop, while the main text color (#333) ensures high contrast for readability. Accent colors like #1abc9c for the main heading, #3498db for subheadings, and #e74c3c for tertiary headings add visual interest without overwhelming the content.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Margin and Padding Choices:</strong> Margins and padding are used strategically to create space between elements and enhance readability. The body has 20px padding to ensure the content does not touch the edges of the browser. Headings have padding and margin adjustments to separate them from the content that follows, making the document more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>HTML Abuse:</strong> Originally, some HTML tags were used based on their default styling rather than their semantic meaning. For instance, an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag was used for the title of the essay because it looked better, even though it was the highest-level heading. This has been corrected to an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag to maintain proper document structure and accessibility.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Footer Placement:</strong> The footer is placed at the bottom of the page using flexbox to ensure it remains at the bottom regardless of the content length. This approach keeps the layout consistent and professional.
            </p></li>
        </ol>
